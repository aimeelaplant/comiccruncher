# Contributing

Pull requests that will be looked at are restricted to collaborators only. The built Go binary gets deployed to an actual server through CircleCI, and the private credentials used by CircleCI are not shared through forks of this repository.

Whenever a more streamlined process that doesn't expose sensitive credentials is figured out, I'll open up pull requests to the public.
